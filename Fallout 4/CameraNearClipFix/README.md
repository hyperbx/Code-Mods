# Camera Near Clip Fix
Fixes the camera clipping through geometry in first-person by adjusting its near distance to account for the field of view.

>[!WARNING]
>This mod has only been tested as far as the intro sequence and first area outside of Vault 111, I quite literally just made this on a whim so I could enjoy my first (real) playthrough of the game at ultrawide with 110 FOV without the camera clipping. If I come across any issues along the way, I'll make note of them here. Otherwise, I'll upload to Nexus Mods later.
